Simple Vocab Plus 2 (plugin for Omeka)
====================================

This [Omeka] 2.1+ plugin allows administrators to create, edit, and update 
controlled vocabularies either defined in Omeka (brand new term lists, or
values already stored) or in the cloud. 

[Simple Vocab Plus 2] is an improved fork of the [Simple Vocab Plus] pugin, 
based on the official [Simple Vocab]. The user interface is optimized too.
